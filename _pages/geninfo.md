Growing Up
======
I was born and raised in Arvada, Colorado, to a family of five. As the middle child of three sons, I got the best of both worlds - learning from my older brother and being able to guide my younger. I went to and graduated from Ralston Valley High School as Valedictorian (which meant close to nothing due to the award being given to 25 of the 420 graduating students). My father was my high school physics teacher, and I aspire to be more like him every day. My mother is my biggest supporter, and will always have my back.

College Life
======
After high school, I moved out to Tucson, Arizona to pursue a degree in Mathematics at the University of Arizona. Through COVID and conversations with my peers, as well as taking a course from Dr. Christina Duron, I decided to switch to Statistics and Data Sciences halfway through my Sophomore year. This change of direction was pivotal to the rest of my academic career. I then continued on this path, enjoying statistical analysis much more than theoretical proofs, even deciding to take on an Accelerated Master's program within the University. I am in the process of completing this program, before I move out to Costa Mesa to work as a Project Analyst for Brailsford & Dunlavey, a consulting firm that leads the planning, development, and management of the places that shape and strengthen our communities (mainly Higher Education, K-12, Municipalities, and Venues).
