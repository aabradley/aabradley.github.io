While being in the marching band, I was also lucky enough to be a member of the Pep Band here at the University.
This select group gets to participate at Men's basketball games, Women's basketball games, Volleyball games, and other miscellaneous events.
We are also lucky enough to be able to travel with teams for en-of-year tournaments (such as Pac-12 basketball, March Madness, etc.). 
As an avid fan of basketball and other sports, this has been a thrilling experience for me.
