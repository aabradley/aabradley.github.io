Graduate Assistant for MATH 100

Info
======
As the Graduate Assistant for MATH 100, I held office hours for Asynchronous versions of MATH 100. I also held meetings with students regarding their placement, grades, and conduct. I was a point of contact for undergraduate teaching assistants, working alongside course coordinators and Math Academic Coaches (MAC).
